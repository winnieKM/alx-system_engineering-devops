================================

ðŸ“Œ Infrastructure Overview:
This is a more reliable and scalable setup than Task 0. It uses 3 servers: one for load balancing and two to handle website requests.

ðŸ§­ How it Works:
1. A user types www.foobar.com in their browser.
2. DNS resolves the domain to the IP of the **load balancer**.
3. The load balancer sends the request to one of two application servers.
4. Each app server runs Nginx and hosts the same codebase.
5. The app server queries the MySQL database and returns a response.
6. The user receives the webpage in their browser.
